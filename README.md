# ClassRegistration

A program written in Powershell. This program takes a username and password to log into Banner Web. It then navigates to the registration tab and waits until
registration opens at 7:30. Once the time hits, it will input my personal code for this registration. It will then input all the classes I want and hit enter faster than
any person can. Not a guarentee, but there is a very high chance you will get your classes with it.
